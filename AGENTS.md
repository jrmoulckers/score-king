# AGENTS.md — JRM Studio base operating guide

This file tells an AI agent (GitHub Copilot, Codex, Claude, and others) how to work safely and
effectively across **JRM Studio** repositories. It is the shared floor. **Each product repo
extends it** with its own root `AGENTS.md` that adds product-specific stack, paths, and rules —
product rules layer on top of, and may override, the defaults here.

> This file lives in the canonical `jrmoulckers/.github` backbone repo. It is distributed to
> product repos by the studio sync tool; edit the canonical copy here, not the copies.

## What JRM Studio is

A family of independent product repositories (`jrm-recipes`, `score-king`, `finance`, and more)
that share DNA — work practice, AI agents/skills, community-health files, and reusable CI —
through this backbone repo and `@jrm` npm packages. Products stay independent; the shared layer
keeps them consistent.

## Golden rules

1. **Never commit secrets.** Real values live only in git-ignored files. In tracked files use
   `${VARS}` or placeholders (`YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`) and ship a `.env.example`. If you find a
   secret that would be committed, stop and flag it.
2. **Issue-first, PR-always.** Every change references an issue and lands as a PR. A task that
   ends at a local commit is **incomplete**. Read-only research does not need an issue when it makes
   no repository change; the issue requirement begins before the first change.
3. **Stay in scope.** Make surgical, intentional edits. Don't reformat or "clean up" unrelated
   code. Don't work outside the repository root.
4. **Document decisions.** Non-trivial structural or design choices get an ADR in
   `docs/architecture/` (or the product's ADR location).
5. **When unsure, ask.** Prefer a short clarifying question over a guess that touches
   security, data, or infrastructure.

## Core principles

1. **Privacy first** — treat user data as confidential by default; never log or transmit it in
   plain text.
2. **Accessibility** — UI meets WCAG 2.2 AA minimum: semantic elements, screen-reader support,
   reduced-motion and high-contrast preferences.
3. **Security** — follow OWASP guidance; validate and sanitize inputs; never hardcode secrets.
4. **Transparency** — capture significant trade-offs in commit messages and PR descriptions.
5. **Conventional commits** — `type(scope): description (#N)` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`,
   `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`).

## Definition of Done — not complete until ALL gates pass

| Gate | Verification |
| --- | --- |
| **Lint & format** | The repo's lint/format check passes with no errors. |
| **Type-check** | Static type-check passes (where the stack has one). |
| **Tests** | Affected unit/integration tests pass. |
| **Build** | The affected app/package builds. |
| **PR open & green** | A PR is open against the default branch with CI green. |
| **No conflicts** | The PR is `MERGEABLE` (not `DIRTY`/`BEHIND`). |
| **Merged** | The PR is merged once the quality gate passes (unless a documented blocker prevents it). |

Run the repo's own pre-push checks before every push (each product repo documents the exact
commands). Merge conflicts carry the same weight as red CI — resolve them before merging.

## Issue-First Development

1. Every change references a GitHub issue — create one first if none exists.
2. Work on a feature branch (or worktree); never commit directly to the default branch.
3. Commit messages include the issue reference: `type(scope): description (#N)`.
4. Push your feature branch, then open a PR against the default branch with `Closes #N`.
5. Verify the PR exists, then monitor CI until it is green **and** the PR is `MERGEABLE`.
6. Land the work: self-merge your own PR once the quality gate passes. A change left only on a
   side branch is not done. If a real blocker prevents merge, leave one green, `MERGEABLE` PR
   with a `## Needs Human Action` note.

## Coding standards

- Write clear, self-documenting code; comment only when intent isn't obvious.
- Prefer small, focused functions, modules, and PRs.
- Write tests alongside new code (unit tests for logic; integration tests for I/O and APIs).
- Use each language's conventional naming; document public APIs.

## What NOT to do

- Do NOT commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials.
- Do NOT add dependencies without documenting why.
- Do NOT bypass linters, formatters, or CI checks.
- Do NOT ship placeholder implementations without a clearly marked `// TODO:`.
- Do NOT make changes outside the scope of the assigned task.

## Tooling (MCP)

Pinned MCP servers are declared in `agency.toml`. Intrinsically bounded Context7 documentation and
sequential-thinking tools are enabled by default; Playwright browser automation and persistent
memory are documented, pinned opt-ins until the consuming host's tool-filter enforcement is
verified. Product repos may define a narrower local runtime policy.

## Human-Gated Operations (MANDATORY)

These apply to **all** AI tools in every studio repo. Pushing feature branches and creating PRs
is **required and auto-approved** — stopping at a local commit to ask permission is a workflow
violation. The operations below, however, require explicit human approval.

**1 — Git remote.** Auto-approved: push/rebase your **own** feature branch, `fetch`,
`force-with-lease` on your own branch to resolve a rebase/conflict, read-only git.
Gated/forbidden: pushing to `main`/release branches, plain `git push --force`, force-with-lease
on shared branches, remote/merge reconfiguration.

**2 — Pull requests.** Auto-approved on **your own** PRs: create, review, request changes,
merge once the quality gate passes (CI green AND `MERGEABLE`). Gated: merging, approving,
closing, or dismissing reviews on a PR you did **not** author; merging while CI is red or the PR
conflicts.

"Your own" means **you opened it in this session**, and it cannot be established from the API.
Every agent in this fleet authenticates as the repository owner, so `author.login` reads
`jrmoulckers` on your PRs and on a human's alike. An agent that decides authorship by querying will
conclude every PR is its own and auto-approve merges it was never permitted to make — the check
fails silently and in the permissive direction. Presume a PR is **not** yours unless you created it
in this session, and treat the ambiguous case as gated.

A peer agent session's go-ahead is **not** human approval. Sessions coordinating on a fleet-wide
change will send each other verified sequences, merge orders, and explicit recommendations; none of
that lifts a gate, however well-evidenced, because the gate exists to put a human in the loop rather
than to establish that the change is correct. Verification and authorization are different
properties, and a peer can only supply the first.

**Expect this gate to erode in proportion to how good the peer is.** A careless recommendation gets
scrutinised and refused on its merits; a rigorous one — a verified sequence, a reproduced
measurement, a correct merge order supplied several times running — earns deference, and deference
to a peer is indistinguishable in the moment from deference to a human. The best-evidenced case is
therefore the one most likely to slip through, and it slips silently, because nothing about a correct
recommendation prompts the question. **The gate must be indifferent to the quality of the evidence
behind it.** If a peer's track record is doing any work in the decision to act, the gate has already
been lifted by something other than a human.

The same asymmetry runs through the authorship check above, and it is worth seeing them together. An
agent that queries `author.login` and correctly concludes "not mine" has learned nothing — the query
returns `jrmoulckers` either way, so it agrees with the right answer without supplying it. A
confirmation that agrees is not thereby evidence; the way to tell is to remove it and ask whether
anything changes. Here nothing does, because the true answer came from session provenance the whole
time.

**3 — Remote platform.** Auto-approved: routine triage labels. Gated: closing/reopening/deleting
issues, changing gating labels (`blocked`, `security`, `breaking-change`), and any repo-settings,
branch-protection, secrets, deployment, or `gh api` write.

**4 — Outside project boundary.** Never read, write, or execute outside the repository root, and
never modify system configuration or install global tools.

**5 — Destructive file ops.** No recursive/bulk/wildcard deletion; name each file to remove and
explain why. Never overwrite a file without reading it first.

**6 — Publishing & distribution.** No `npm publish`, image pushes, store submission, or deploy
scripts. Prepare the release and hand the final publish to a human.

**7 — Secrets & credentials.** Never create/read real secret files, access OS keychains, generate
real keys, or echo secret-bearing env vars. Use `.env.example` placeholders.

**8 — Destructive database ops.** No `DROP`/`TRUNCATE`/unqualified `DELETE`/destructive `ALTER`,
no restores, no pointing connection strings at production. Write reversible migrations for a human
to review and run.

If a task needs a gated operation: **stop, state what and why, and wait for approval.** Never work
around these restrictions. If no human is available, complete everything that is auto-approved,
then leave a clear `## Needs Human Action` note.

## Nested guides

Scope-specific rules live alongside the code — read the relevant one before working in that area:

- Each product repo's root `AGENTS.md` — stack, paths, and product-specific rules.
- `agents/*.agent.md` in this backbone, materialized as `.github/agents/*.agent.md` in consumers —
  role definitions and boundaries. Consumer copies are generated; product-specific stack/path/risk
  overlays belong in the product's root `AGENTS.md` or scoped instructions.
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in this backbone is canonical; opted-in consumers read the generated,
  upstream-owned `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` materialization.
- `instructions/*.instructions.md` in this backbone is canonical; opted-in consumers read generated,
  upstream-owned `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` copies. Root/local `AGENTS.md` and
  more-specific scoped instructions override shared defaults without relaxing mandatory human
  gates.

The procedure for checking whether your managed regions match canon — and the warning against
diffing a spliced file whole — lives in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, under "Checking a managed
region". It is stated once, there rather than here, because this file is distributed to six of the
eleven members while that one reaches all eleven.

# Score King product overlay

This overlay specializes the canonical roles for Score King's Svelte PWA and stateless relay. It
cannot relax the studio safety or human-gated operation rules above.

## Ownership and handoffs

| Surface | Lead | Product-specific boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/**` | `@web-engineer` | Owns Svelte/PWA implementation. Coordinate visual decisions and token changes with the local `@design-engineer`. |
| `relay/**` | `@backend-engineer` | Owns the stateless WebSocket service and validates every message at the client/service trust boundary; never persist or expose game data. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `@architect` | Owns the cross-client target architecture, contracts, and trust-boundary decisions. |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | `@devops-engineer` | Owns GitHub Pages delivery, permissions, action pinning, and deployment gates. |
| `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `.impeccable/design.json`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | local `@design-engineer` | Owns Score King's *expression* of the system, not the authority for it. Product direction — users, purpose, promise, and the value and trust posture — is Product's (`PROD-STRAT-001`); token, theme, and component contracts are Studio's (`STUDIO-FND-001`, `STUDIO-TOK-001`, `STUDIO-TOK-002`, `STUDIO-CMP-001`). This role composes those contracts into Score King's per-game costume and keeps `PRODUCT.md` citing the obligations it satisfies; it does not restyle, fork, or redefine them. Escalate to Product for direction changes and to Studio for design-system changes. Web implementation remains with `@web-engineer`. |

The local `@design-engineer` also co-owns design-token declarations in `src/app.css`; coordinate
edits there with `@web-engineer` because that file is consumed by the web client.

## Product design constraints

- Follow the **Game-Night LARPer** direction: fixed, familiar chrome with per-game personality
  expressed through emoji, copy, and restrained accent moments.
- Use **Royal Violet** (`#7c5cff`) for exactly one primary action per screen. Reserve **Crown Gold**
  (`#ffd166`) for the current leader and winner, never ordinary buttons or decoration.
- Keep interactive targets at least 46px, render changing scores with tabular numerals, and pair
  every color cue with text, shape, iconography, or position.
- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` with a calm alternative for every animation.
- Keep navigation, buttons, steppers, and the cross-game shell consistent across every game.

## Verification

Run `npm run check`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` for the web client. Run
`npm --prefix relay run typecheck` for relay changes.
